## Introduction
The API ensures that all data the front end requires is ready the instant it's requested without having to go over the wire to get it.

## Usage

You can override the default ENV variables defined in `.env` by changing this file - or defining them as environment vars. You can check your current configuration with

`npm run show-config`

Once you are satisfied with the configuration, run

`npm install`

`npm start`

## Unit tests

`npm run test`

## Linting 

`npm run lint`
